# My Journey Begins...

I already have some experience using Java, C, and C++ from my projects at Purdue.
Maybe a lot of people feel like this, but I believe I am still completely clueless. 

Hopefully documenting my progress will do some good... I will also learn source control.

## Learning Simple Syntax

I have spent a fair deal of time watching tutotials on Python syntax.
It is time to get off my a$$ and actually implement/solidify my knowledge.

## Simple Projects

I searched around for the best projects to work on and found some simple projects 
which will hopefully give me a good base in Python.

### Project 1: Number Guessing Game

This was very straightforward. 

I had to search how to find a random number...
```python
# random number from 1 to 100 (inclusive)
import random
target = random.randint(1, 100)
```

I also forgot about converting integers to strings before printing them
This is easily done with str() function

When using a for loop or any other situation, range(1, 11) would include numbers from 1 to 10 

### Project 2: Rock Paper Scissors

### Project 3: Hangman

### Project 4: Password Generator

### Project 5: Tic Tac Toe

### Project 6: Implement Linked List
